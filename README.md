# NewInTown - The App For The Busy Traveler
NewInTown is an intuitive IOS app that allows users to easily see all of the important but often forgotten nearby vecinities at a glance. No more searching around endlessly on Google Maps trying
to sift through data upon data that doesn't even relate to what you searched for.

NewInTown was made for the traveler: every place that a traveler would likely need during their stay is right there in the app. Additionally, travlers can favorite the places they have been to and enjoyed, or places they will be planning to visit, so all of their favorite places are
conveniently stored in one place: the favorites list. Another feature of NewInTown is that users can plan which vicinities they will be utilizing by importing their future destinations.

This is an IOS app that utilizes Radar SDK to fetch nearby places based on category. NewInTown was developed by Emily Cooper and Frankie Furnelli from the University of Massachusetts Amherst for HackUMass 2020. (Side note: GetMeHelp was our original app idea, which is the reason why the files take on a different name then the repository.
